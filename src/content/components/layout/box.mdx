## Import

```js
import { Box } from "@prismane/core";
```

## Usage

The `Box` component is the base of all Prismane components. It is useful, because it provides the following features:

- An easy way of styling using [shorthand props](/docs/styling/style-props) (for e.g. _cl_ instead of _color_).
- A [sx](/docs/styling/sx-prop) style prop that can easily handle complex styling.
- An [as](/docs/getting-started/versatile-components) prop that allows you to compose a new component and override the default element or component.

You can use the `Box` component as the base for your component or to replace your HTML code.

```jsx preview
<Box as="a" href="/" w="100%" p={fr(6)} bg="amethyst">
  My Box component that will render an anchor.
</Box>
```
