<Details summary="Additional steps to include the icons used in the examples">
To install the icons used in the examples you have to install the `@phosphor-icon/react` package.

This can be done by running the following command:

```json files={[ { name: "npm", value: "npm i @phopshor-icons/react", language: "json", icon: <Npm />, }, { name: "yarn", value: "yarn add @phosphor-icons/react", language: "json", icon: <Yarn />, }, { name: "pnpm", value: "pnpm add @phosphor-icons/react", language: "json", icon: <Pnpm />, }, ]}

```

</Details>

## Usage

The `Icon` component provides a frame around any icon and also provides the consistency in sizing.

```jsx preview
<Icon>
  <Heart />
</Icon>
```

### Icon Sizes

Use the _size_ prop to change the size of the icon. You can set the value to _xs_, _sm_, _base_, _md_, _lg_ or any other valid custom size. By default, the _base_ value is used.

```jsx preview
<>
  <Icon size="xs">
    <SquaresFour />
  </Icon>
  <Icon size="sm">
    <SquaresFour />
  </Icon>
  <Icon size="base">
    <SquaresFour />
  </Icon>
  <Icon size="md">
    <SquaresFour />
  </Icon>
  <Icon size="lg">
    <SquaresFour />
  </Icon>
  <Icon size="52px">
    <SquaresFour />
  </Icon>
</>
```

### As A Frame

The `Icon` component can also be used to frame the icon.

```jsx preview
<Icon size="lg" bg="primary" cl="white" br={5}>
  <Wrench size={24} />
</Icon>
```
