```js
import { Key } from "@prismane/core";
```

## Usage

### Modifiers

You can use the _+_ symbol to indicate that a combination of keys is will activate the shortcut.

```jsx preview
<span>
  <Key>shift</Key> + <Key>H</Key>
</span>
```

For a sequence of keys, where one key follows the other, you can use the _then_ word.

```jsx preview
<span>
  <Key>shift</Key> then <Key>M</Key>
</span>
```

If two keys can activate the shortcut or if the keys might look different on the user's keyboard, you can use the _or_ word.

```jsx preview
<span>
  <Key>shift</Key> or <Key>T</Key>
</span>
```
