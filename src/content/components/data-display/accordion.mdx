## Import

Prismane's `Accordion` component has 4 additional inner components:

- _Accordion.Item_: A single accordion item.
- _Accordion.Control_: The control that toggles the expansion of the given item.
- _Accordion.Panel_: The container whose contents are revealed.
- _Accordion.Icon_: An icon that is animated based on the expanded/collapsed state.

```js
import { Accordion } from "@prismane/core";
```

## Usage

```jsx preview
<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item value="first">
    <Accordion.Control>
      First
      <Accordion.Icon />
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>First Panel Content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>

  <Accordion.Item value="second">
    <Accordion.Control>
      Second
      <Accordion.Icon />
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>Second Panel Content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Default Value

You can set an item that will be toggled by default, by passing the _defaultValue_ variable to the `Accordion` component. You can pass any _value_ of any `Accordion.Item` and that item will be toggled by default.

```jsx preview
<Accordion defaultValue="first">
  <Accordion.Item value="first">
    <Accordion.Control>
      First
      <Accordion.Icon />
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>This panel will be expanded by default.</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>

  <Accordion.Item value="second">
    <Accordion.Control>
      Second
      <Accordion.Icon />
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>This one will be closed by default.</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Custom Accordion Icon

You can change the default _chevron-down_ icon, by passing a new one as a child of the `Accordion.Icon` component.

To animate the icon, you can make the child a function that accepts the _active_ parameter, which indicates if the given item is toggled or not.

```jsx preview
<Accordion defaultValue="first">
  <Accordion.Item value="first">
    <Accordion.Control>
      First
      <Accordion.Icon>
        {(active) => (
          <Transition
            as={Plus}
            sx={{ transform: active ? "rotate(135deg)" : "rotate(0deg)" }}
          />
        )}
      </Accordion.Icon>
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>Changed Default Icon Accordion</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>

  <Accordion.Item value="second">
    <Accordion.Control>
      Second
      <Accordion.Icon>
        {(active) => (
          <Transition
            as={Plus}
            sx={{ transform: active ? "rotate(135deg)" : "rotate(0deg)" }}
          />
        )}
      </Accordion.Icon>
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>Changed Default Icon Accordion</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```
