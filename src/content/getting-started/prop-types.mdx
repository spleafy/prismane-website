Our package exports prop types for each of our components. They can be found useful by some developers.
There is a naming convention about forming the name of the component props.
The convention is to add `Props` as a suffix to the component's name.<br />
For example, the `<Button/>` component's prop types are named as `ButtonProps`.
<br/>
All the component props are exported at `@prismane/core`.
<br/>
For example, the `<Chip/>` component's prop types can be imported by doing the following:

```tsx
import { ChipProps } from "@prismane/core";
```

## Usage

The main usage of prop types is to still keep the TypeScript support when creating custom components built on top of Prismane's components

```tsx
import { ChipProps } from "@prismane/core";

function CustomChip({ children, ...props }: ChipProps) {
  return (
    <Chip color="teal" br={fr(2)} {...props}>
      {children}
    </Chip>
  );
}

function Demo() {
  return <CustomChip>Custom Chip</CustomChip>;
}
```

### Versatile Components Prop Types

Versatile components' prop types are generic prop types that have to have a value passed to them, so that you get the right type. <br />
In the following example, we are passing the "button" value to the `ButtonProps` in order to get proper props for the button versatile component. <br />
The versatile components prop types are available for all the [versatile components](docs/getting-started/versatile-components) in Prismane.

```tsx
import { ButtonProps } from "@prismane/core";

function CustomButton({ children, ...props }: ButtonProps<"button">) {
  return (
    <Button color="white" br="full" {...props}>
      {children}
    </Button>
  );
}

function Demo() {
  return <CustomButton>Custom Chip</CustomButton>;
}
```
