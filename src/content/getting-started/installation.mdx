## Install the Package

In your React project, install Prismane by running one of the following commands:

```json files={[ { name: "npm", value: "npm i @prismane/core", language: "json", icon: <Npm />, }, { name: "yarn", value: "yarn add @prismane/core", language: "json", icon: <Yarn />, }, { name: "pnpm", value: "pnpm add @prismane/core", language: "json", icon: <Pnpm />, }, ]}
```

## Provider Setup

Once Prismane is installed, you have set up the `PrismaneProvider` component. This can be done by navigating to `index.tsx` or `index.tsx` and then wrap the `PrismaneProvider` component around `App`: 

```jsx name="App.tsx" icon={<File />}
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { PrismaneProvider } from '@prismane/core'

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PrismaneProvider>
      <App />
    </PrismaneProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

## Install Icons (Optional)

<Warning>Prismane does not include the icons that are used in examples!</Warning>

If you want to use the icons that are used in the examples, you will have to take some additional steps:

<Details summary="Additional steps to include the icons used in the examples">
To install the icons used in the examples you have to install the `@phosphor-icon/react` package.

This can be done by running the following command:

```json files={[ { name: "npm", value: "npm i @phopshor-icons/react", language: "json", icon: <Npm />, }, { name: "yarn", value: "yarn add @phosphor-icons/react", language: "json", icon: <Yarn />, }, { name: "pnpm", value: "pnpm add @phosphor-icons/react", language: "json", icon: <Pnpm />, }, ]}
```
</Details>

### Customize Theme (Optional)

If you want to use a custom theme, with custom colors, spacing and more, you need to extend the `theme`.

The `PrismaneProvider` component automatically extends the passed `theme` object with the current one. By default, this is the [`base`](/docs/theming/theme-object#base-theme-object) theme. 

You have to provide your theme object to the `theme` prop of the `PrismaneProvider` component.

```jsx name="App.tsx" icon={<File />}
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { PrismaneProvider } from '@prismane/core'

const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: {
      500: "#64748b",
      600: "#4b5563",
      700: "#374151"
    },
  },
};

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PrismaneProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </PrismaneProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```
