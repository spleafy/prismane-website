Some of our components are versatile, meaning that they have the ability to change their root element for an element that you have passed. They have an additional `as` prop. By default versatile components render as a `<div/>` element.

```tsx
import { Flex } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Flex as="a" href="#">
      Hello, world
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

This code snippet will render an anchor tag that has display property of flex.
