Some of our components are versatile, meaning that they have the ability to change their root element for an element
that you have passed instead of the default one. By default versatile components render as a `<div/>` element.

They have an additional `as` prop, which is used to accept the desired component we want them to use.

In the following example, we are using the `Flex` component, but we want to render it as an anchor `<a>` element.
For that reason, we are passing `"a"` to the `as` prop of `Flex` component. This will tell Prismane to render an
anchor tag that has display property as flex.


```tsx
import { Flex } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    // Passing "a" to the as property of the Flex component
    <Flex as="a" href="#">
      Hello, world
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default Page;
```
