Some of Prismane's components are versatile, meaning that they have the ability to change the root element that is rendered with a different element or component.

They have an additional `as` prop, which is used to accept the desired element or component we want them to use.

In the following example, we are using the [`Flex`](/docs/components/layout/flex) component, but we want to render it as an `<a>` element.
For that reason, we are passing _'a'_ to the `as` prop of the [`Flex`](/docs/components/layout/flex) component.

This will tell the [`Flex`](/docs/components/layout/flex) component to render an anchor tag that has a display property of flex.

```tsx
import { Flex } from '@prismane/core';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    // Passing "a" to the as property of the Flex component
    <Flex as="a" href="#">
      Hello, world
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default Page;
```
