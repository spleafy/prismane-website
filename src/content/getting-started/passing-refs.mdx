All the components in Prismane use the `forwardRef` function, so that you can easily pass a ref to the component by using the `ref` prop.
<br/>
Here is a small example of using React's useRef and passing it as a ref prop to the `Flex` component.

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { Flex } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
const ref = useRef(null);

return <Flex ref={ref}>Hello, world</Flex>;
};

export default Page;
```
