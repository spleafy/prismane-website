Prismane's global styles can be easily overwritten. Each layer of a component has a dedicated `className` selector, by which you can change the style of a given layer globally by overwriting it in a stylesheet. The selector for each individual component will be listed on their respective page.

For example, when we want to overwrite the `<Button/>` component's styles, we could do the following:

```css
// index.css

.PrismaneButton-root {
  padding-left: 20px !important;
  padding-right: 40px !important;
  background-color: #ffffff !important;
}

.PrismaneButton-root:hover {
  opacity: 0.5 !important;
}
```

This will now globally overwrite the styles for the `<Button/>` component.

<Warning>
  You have to use the `!important` keyword when you are overwriting the styles!
