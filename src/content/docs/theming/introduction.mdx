## Theming in Prismane

Effective theming is crucial for creating visually appealing and user-friendly applications. Prismane empowers you to achieve this by providing robust theming capabilities.

With a single theme object, you can effortlessly define the look and feel of your entire application, ensuring a cohesive and polished user experience.

## Why use a theme?

A theme is a design blueprint for your application. It's a collection of colors, spacing, and other visual styles that create a unified look and feel. By using a theme, you can maintain consistency throughout your app, enhance the user experience, and streamline design updates.
The theme object allows you to specify and control core visual elements like:

- `Mode` - Choose between light and dark themes.
- `Colors` - Establish a rich and balanced color palette, including primary and base colors, along with
  their corresponding shades.
- `Spacing` - Define consistent margins, paddings, and gutters, ensuring a clean and organized UI layout.
- `Border Radius` - Set the global border radius for a unified aesthetic, or adjust it for specific components to add
  visual distinction.
- `Font` - Define the primary font for your app.

By managing these core visual elements, you can effortlessly create themes that perfectly align with your brand identity or tailor the user experience for different target audiences.
Prismane's flexibility lets you build adaptable UIs that resonate with your users.
