## Overview
The useNetworkStatus hook provides a simple and effective way to track changes in the user's internet connection. It returns a boolean value, isOnline, which dynamically reflects whether the user is currently online or offline. This hook allows developers to easily implement features that respond to network connectivity changes, such as displaying informative messages or adjusting application functionality. Integrating useNetworkStatus enhances the user experience by making applications more aware of their network environment.

import { useNetworkStatus } from '@prismane/core/hooks';

| Name       | Type      | Description                                              |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isOnline` | _boolean_ | The boolean that shows if the user is online or offline. |
