title: 'The sx Prop'
---

If you want to overwrite the styling of the component, you can do that using the `sx` prop. <br />

<br />
The `sx` prop is used to add extra styles to components. It can be used to
overwrite styles for internal layers of the component specifically for that
instance. The prop accepts the default CSS properties that are available with
the added functionality of access to the theme object. It has built in media
query support, pseudo classes, CSS variables and more.

## CSS Property

You can set a CSS property of the component by providing an object with the css rules you want to overwrite.
In this example we will overwrite the `overflow-y` CSS rule to _scroll_

```tsx
import { Box } from '@prismane/core';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        overflowY: 'scroll'
      }}
    >
      Hello, world
    </Box>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Theme Object

As a value of any of the CSS rules you want to overwrite, you can use a function with the theme object as a parameter and use it in your logic.
Let's see how we can set the `overflow-y` value based on the theme's mode.

```tsx
import { Box } from '@prismane/core';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        overflowY: (theme) => (theme.mode === 'dark' ? 'scroll' : 'auto')
      }}
    >
      Hello, world
    </Box>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Class Names

If you want to overwrite a CSS rule inside a CSS class that is being used inside the component, you can set a key woth the class name to the object you provide.
In this example we will set the background to _red_ of element(s) that has a class name of `Box-root` within the Box component.

```tsx
import { Box } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        ".Box-root" {
          background: red;
        }
      }}
    >
      Hello, world
    </Box>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Nesting Styles

Another more sophisticated usage is to use the `sx` prop and set a custom CSS variable and then use it in the `cl` prop of the component.
Here we are defining a custom CSS variable called _--custom-color_ and then use that variable in the color style prop `cl`.

```tsx
import { Box } from '@prismane/core';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        '--custom-color': '#ffffff'
      }}
    >
      <Box cl="var(--custom-color)">Hello, world</Box>
    </Box>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Media Queries

Prismane also provides the ability to use media queries in it's `sx` prop.
Here you will see how we can set the css rule `display` to _none_ if the width of the viewport is bigger than 320px.

```tsx
import { Box } from '@prismane/core';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        '@media (min-width:320px)': {
          display: 'none'
        }
      }}
    >
      Hello, world
    </Box>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Pseudo Classes

You can also use pseudo classes in the CSS rules you want to overwrite.
In this small example we are using the :hover state of the component and we are setting it to be _display:none_.

```tsx
import { Box } from '@prismane/core';

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        ':hover': {
          display: 'none'
        }
      }}
    >
      Hello, world
    </Box>
  );
};

export default Page;
```
