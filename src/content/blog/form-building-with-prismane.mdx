# Introduction

Greetings, everyone! Welcome to our tutorial on form building with Prismane. Throughout this guide, we'll explore the process of constructing forms using Prismane and dive into the utilization of our built-in validators. Let's embark on this journey together!

All of the code in the example below can be directly accessed through the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/spleafy/prismane-form-building).

# useForm hook

Prismane makes form building straightforward. By leveraging the useForm hook, you gain a seamless approach to constructing, validating, and handling forms. The upcoming section provides step-by-step guidance on creating a basic login form.

## Import hook

We can import the `useForm` hook from the `@prismane/core/hooks` entry.

```tsx
import { useForm } from '@prismane/core/hooks';
```

## Initialize the hook

Now, we can initialize the hook and get the `handleReset` , `handleSubmit` and the `register` functions.

The `handleReset` function manages form resets by clearing the hook's state upon reset.

The `handleSubmit` function handles the form submit, and provides the state values of the form and the state of the form. The `handleSubmit` accepts up to three parameters. The first one is the event object, the second one is the `onSubmit` callback function and the last one is the `onError` callback function that is called, when the form fails to validate.

The `register` function simplifies field registration, ensuring proper and necessary props are assigned.

```tsx
const { handleReset, handleSubmit, register } = useForm({});
```

## Add fields to the hook

Great! Now, we have to tell our hook what fields we are going to have. Simply provide a `fields` property within the configuration object passed to the `useForm` hook.

Within the `fields` object, include properties with names corresponding to the intended field names.

For each field, set a `value` property indicating the initial value of the field.

In our case we are going to have a `username` and a `password` fields.

```tsx
const { handleReset, handleSubmit, register } = useForm({
  fields: {
    username: {
      value: ''
    },
    password: {
      value: ''
    }
  }
});
```

## Add Form

Now, we need to add our `Form` and pass the `onSubmit` and `onReset` props.

```tsx
import { Center, Card, Form } from '@prismane/core';
import { useForm } from '@prismane/core/hooks';

function App() {
  const { handleReset, handleSubmit, register } = useForm({
    fields: {
      username: {
        value: ''
      },
      password: {
        value: ''
      }
    }
  });

  return (
    <Center w="100vw" h="100vh">
      <Card>
        <Form
          onSubmit={(e: SubmitEvent) => handleSubmit(e, (v) => console.log(v))}
          onReset={handleReset}
        ></Form>
      </Card>
    </Center>
  );
}

export default App;
```

As you can see, we've linked the `handleSubmit` function to the `onSubmit` event. We've supplied just two parameters to `handleSubmit` - the event object and the `onSubmit` callback function, responsible for logging values to the console upon successful submission.

Additionally, we assigned the `handleReset` function to the `onReset` prop, ensuring a reset of our components' values and form state.

## Add fields

Now, letâ€™s add our fields and a submit button. We are going to use the `TextField` for our username and the `PasswordField` for our password.

```tsx
import { ..., TextField, PasswordField, Button } from "@prismane/core";
...

...
<Form
  onSubmit={(e: SubmitEvent) => handleSubmit(e, (v) => console.log(v))}
	onReset={handleReset}
>
  <TextField />
  <PasswordField />
	<Button type="submit">Submit Form</Button>
</Form>
...
```

## Register fields

Great! Now, lets register our fields. To do that, we are going to use the `register` function that we got from the `useForm` hook.

We need to pass a single parameter to the `register` function, which is the name of the field undergoing registration.

<Note>
  ðŸ’¡Make sure to provide the same name to the `register` function, as the one
  that you provided in the `fields` object, otherwise the field will not
  register correctly!
</Note>

The `register` function returns an object that contains essential field properties. Because of that, we must spread this function across the component. The `register` function returns properties such as `onChange`, `onBlur`, `onFocus`, `value`, `name`, and `id`.

```tsx
...
  <TextField {...register("username")} placeholder="Enter username" label="Username:" />
  <PasswordField {...register("password")} placeholder="Enter password" label="Password:" />
...
```

Great! Now, letâ€™s try out our form and see what is logged to the console!

# Prismaneâ€™s Validators

Every field within the `useForm` hook has a `validators` property. Within this property's object, we list the validators assigned to the field.

The validators must be added in following order, because the hook validates them one by one. If one returns an error, the hook stops validating and handles the error.

Each validator is represented by a function that takes the field's value as the parameter `v`, passes this value to the validator function, and then invokes the validator function.

Prismane's validator functions return `null` when there is no error. In case of an error, they provide an error message as a `string`.

## Adding Validators

In our example, we are going to add the `required` and `username` validators to our username field and we are going to add the `required` and the `min` validator to the password field.

The `required` validator ensures that the given value is defined and not empty, confirming it has a valid and meaningful content. It can handle both numbers, strings and booleans.

The `username` validators checks if the provided value is a valid username or not. Itâ€™s regex can be overwritten, if you provide a regex as the second parameter.

The `min` validator checks if the provided valueâ€™s length is more than a given number. The error message can be personalized to the field, by providing a third parameter, which is the fieldâ€™s name.

## Import validators

Firstly, we have to import our validators from the `@prismane/core/validators` entry.

```tsx
import { required, username, min } from '@prismane/core/validators';
```

## Add validators to fields in useForm hook

Next, we are going to add the validators to the `validators` property of each of our fields.

```tsx
...
username: {
  value: "",
  validators: {
    required: (v) => required(v),
    username: (v) => username(v),
  },
},
password: {
  value: "",
  validators: {
    required: (v) => required(v),
    min: (v) => min(v, 4),
  },
},
...
```

Great! Now, letâ€™s see the final result

<Note>
  ðŸ’¡ As you can see, form submission is unavailable until all of the fields are
  error-free.
</Note>

Fantastic job! You now can successfully create forms and handle them using Prismane!
