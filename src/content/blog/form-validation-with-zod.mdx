# Introduction

Greetings, everyone! Welcome to our tutorial on form validation in Prismane using the Zod library. 

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It allows developers to define data structures (schemas) in a type-safe manner and provides validation functions to ensure that data adheres to the specified structure.

By using Zod in Prismane, developers can leverage their form validation even more by easily creating more complex validators.

All of the code in the example below can be directly accessed through the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/spleafy/prismane-form-building).

Before continuing, you should get familiar with the [Zod library](https://zod.dev), if you are not.

# Initial Setup

From this point on, we will accept that you understand how Prismaneâ€™s useForm hooks works and you know how to build forms using Prismane. If not, please refer to this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@prismaneui/form-building-with-prismane-e84a99e90ccb).

## Install Zod

Firstly, we need to install the `zod` package from the `npm` registry. We can do this by running this command:

```bash
npm install zod
```

## Initial App

Now, we are going to use this initial app built only with Prismane:

```tsx
import {
  Center,
  Card,
  Form,
  Button,
  TextField,
  PasswordField,
} from "@prismane/core";
import { useForm } from "@prismane/core/hooks";
import { z } from "zod";

function App() {
  const { handleSubmit, handleReset, register } = useForm({
    fields: {
      username: {
        value: "",
        validators: {
          required: (v) => p(v, z.string()),
          min: (v) => p(v, z.string().min(5)),
        },
      },
      password: {
        value: "",
        validators: {
          required: (v) => p(v, z.string()),
          min: (v) => p(v, z.string().min(5)),
        },
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <Center w="100vw" h="100vh">
      <Card w={300} h={400}>
        <Form
          onSubmit={(e: any) => {
            handleSubmit(e, (v: any) => console.log(v));
          }}
          onReset={() => handleReset()}
        >
          <TextField
            placeholder="Enter username: "
            label="Username:"
            {...register("username")}
          />
          <PasswordField
            placeholder="Enter password: "
            label="Password:"
            {...register("password")}
          />
          <Button variant="primary" type="submit">
            Submit
          </Button>
        </Form>
      </Card>
    </Center>
  );
}

export default App;
```

<Note>ðŸ’¡ This application creates a form using the `useForm` hook, creates a form and registers two fields - `username` and `password`.</Note>

## Adapt Zod to Prismane Validators

Great! Now, let's solve a key problem. Zod's validators don't work seamlessly with Prismane by default. To fix this, we'll create a function that adapts Zod validators to fit Prismane's form validation style. This way, you can smoothly use Zod with Prismane for your forms.

Firstly, letâ€™s create the `zodToPrismane` file, where we will create our transform function.

```bash
touch zodToPrismane.ts
```

Then, inside the `zodToPrismane.ts` file, we are going to add the following function:

```tsx
const p = (value: any, validator: any) => {
  const result = validator.safeParse(value);

  if (!result.success) {
    return result.error.errors[0].message;
  }

  return null;
};

export default p;
```

We are going to name it `p` so it can be shorter and not visually blocking when we use it.

<Note>The `p` function executes Zod's validator and provides the error message if there's one, or `null` if there are no errors.</Note>

## Add Validators

Now, after having the `p` function, we can easily add Zod validators to Prismaneâ€™s `useForm` hook:

```tsx
...
import p from "./zodToPrismane";
...

...
const { handleSubmit, handleReset, register } = useForm({
  fields: {
    username: {
      value: "",
      validators: {
        required: (v) => p(v, z.string().min(1)),
        min: (v) => p(v, z.string().min(5)),
      },
    },
    password: {
      value: "",
      validators: {
        required: (v) => p(v, z.string().min(1)),
        min: (v) => p(v, z.string().min(5)),
      },
    },
  },
});
...
```

<Note>
ðŸ’¡ We are adding two validators to each of our fields - required and min.
</Note>
<Note>
The `required` validator isnâ€™t directly supported by Zod, so we will have to check if the length of the value is at least 1 using the `.min()` property of the `z.string()` validator.
</Note>
<Note>
The `min` validator can be created by using the `.min()` property of the `z.string()` validator.
</Note>

Letâ€™s see the current result:

## Customizing the Error Messages

With Zod, we can modify the default error messages to create more personalized errors for our fields.

For the `required` validator we can pass an object to the `z.string().min()` and give a value to the `message` property.

```tsx
username: {
 ...
  validators: {
    required: (v) => p(v, z.string.min(1, {
      message: "The username field is required!",
    })),
		...
  },
},
password: {
  ...
  validators: {
    required: (v) => p(v, z.string.min(1, {
      message: "The password field is required!",
    })),
    ...
  },
},
```

For the `min` validator we can pass an object as a second parameter to the `.min()` and give a value to the `message` property.

```tsx
username: {
  ...
  validators: {
    ...
    min: (v) =>
      p(
        v,
        z.string().min(5, {
          message: "Username must be longer than 5 characters!",
        })
      ),
  },
},
password: {
  ...
  validators: {
    ...
    min: (v) =>
      p(
        v,
        z.string().min(5, {
          message: "The password must be longer than 5 characters!",
        })
      ),
  },
},
```

Great! Now all of the error messages are changed and personalized for the fields that we have and use.

Now, letâ€™s see the final result:

Great, now you can build even form validators with ease using Prismane and Zod!
