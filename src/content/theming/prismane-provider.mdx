To enable Prismane's theming capabilities in your application, wrap your app with the `<PrismaneProvider/>`
component

We can import the `PrismaneProvider` component from the `@prismane/core` library.

```tsx
import { PrismaneProvider } from '@prismane/core';
```

## Basic Usage

If you just want to use the [`base`](/docs/theming/theme-object#base-theme-object) theme in your application, simply wrap your app's main component with the
`<PrismaneProvider/>` component.
No additional configuration is required like in this simple example.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Application from '../somewhere';
// Importing PrismaneProvider component
import { PrismaneProvider } from '@prismane/core';

const App = () => {
  return (
    /* Wrapping the Application component
    with the PrismaneProvider */
    <PrismaneProvider>
      <Application />
    </PrismaneProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

<Warning>
  Importing and wrapping your application with the `<PrismaneProvider />` is a
  requirement in order to provide the theming functionality across your
  application.
</Warning>

## Custom Theming Usage

If you want to customize some or all properties of the theme, you can do it by creating your own theme object and provide it as a _theme_ prop to the `<PrismaneProvider/>`.
Prismane is coming with a huge [color palette](docs/styling/color-palette) that you can use to form your own theme object.

The color palette is being exported at `@prismane/core` as a constant named `PRISMANE_COLORS`. In this example we gonna use it to form the colors of our theme object.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Application from '../somewhere';

// Importing PRISMANE_COLORS from Prismane
import { PRISMANE_COLORS, PrismaneProvider } from '@prismane/core';

const App = () => {
  const theme = {
    mode: 'dark',
    colors: {
      primary: { ...PRISMANE_COLORS.ruby }, // Setting the primary colors
      base: { ...PRISMANE_COLORS.slate } // Setting the base colors
    },
    spacing: '5px'
  };

  return (
    /* Provide the theme object as a theme prop */
    <PrismaneProvider theme={theme}>
      <Application />
    </PrismaneProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```
