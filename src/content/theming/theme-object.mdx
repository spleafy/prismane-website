## Theming in Prismane

Effective theming is crucial for creating visually appealing and user-friendly applications. Prismane empowers you to achieve this by providing robust theming capabilities.

With a single theme object, you can effortlessly define the look and feel of your entire application, ensuring a cohesive and polished user experience.

## Why using a theme?

A theme is a design blueprint for your application. It's a collection of colors, spacing, and other visual styles that create a unified look and feel. By using a theme, you can maintain consistency throughout your app, enhance the user experience, and streamline design updates.
The theme object allows you to specify and control core visual elements like:

- `Mode` - Choose between light and dark themes.
- `Colors` - Establish a rich and balanced color palette, including primary and base colors, along with
their corresponding shades.
- `Spacing` - Define consistent margins, paddings, and gutters, ensuring a clean and organized UI layout.
- `Border Radius` - Set the global border radius for a unified aesthetic, or adjust it for specific components to add
visual distinction.
- `Font` - Define the primary font for your app.

By managing these core visual elements, you can effortlessly create themes that perfectly align with your brand identity or tailor the user experience for different target audiences.
Prismane's flexibility lets you build adaptable UIs that resonate with your users.

## Defining the theme object

The theme object is the object of type `PrismaneTheme` which you can use to define your custom theme.
The object can hold some or all fields following this logic:


| Name        | Type                  | Description                       | Default Value |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `mode`      | _Enum_ `light` or `dark`     | Controlling the mode of the theme | `light`       |
| `colors`    | _Object_                 | Holds information about `primary` and `base` colors with their respected shades                 | -             |
| `spacing` | _string_ | Controls spacing/padding/margins between and within the components          |  `4px`            |
| `borderRadius` | _Object_ | Sets border radius of components in all the different sizes          | -          |
| `fontFamily` | _string_ | Font family that will be used across the whole application          |  `4px`            |


Here is the types
```ts
export interface PrismaneTheme {
  // The theme mode "dark" or "light"
  mode: "light" | "dark",

  // The theme colors
  colors: {
    primary: {
      50: string;
      100: string;
      200: string;
      300: string;
      400: string;
      500: string;
      600: string;
      700: string;
      800: string;
      900: string;
    },
    base: {
      50: string;
      100: string;
      200: string;
      300: string;
      400: string;
      500: string;
      600: string;
      700: string;
      800: string;
      900: string;
    },
  },

  // The theme spacing, changing it will scale up or down the size of
  // your components
  spacing: string;

  // The border radius to be used in the components
  borderRadius: {
    xs: string;
    sm: string;
    base: string;
    md: string;
    lg: string;
    xl: string;
    "2xl": string;
  },

  // the font family that should be used across the whole interface
  fontFamily: string;

}
```

## Base Theme Object

By default, Prismane uses it's own default theme object, which looks like this:

```ts
const base: PrismaneTheme = {
  mode: "light",
  colors: {
    primary: {
      // Prismane's diamond colors
      50: "#f0f9ff",
      100: "#e0f2fe",
      200: "#bae6fd",
      300: "#7dd3fc",
      400: "#38bdf8",
      500: "#0ea5e9",
      600: "#0284c7",
      700: "#0369a1",
      800: "#075985",
      900: "#0c4a6e",
    },
    base: {
      // Prismane's gray colors
      50: "#f9fafb",
      100: "#f3f4f6",
      200: "#e5e7eb",
      300: "#d1d5db",
      400: "#9ca3af",
      500: "#6b7280",
      600: "#4b5563",
      700: "#374151",
      800: "#1f2937",
      900: "#111827",
    },
  },
  spacing: "4px",
  borderRadius: {
    xs: fr(0.75),
    sm: fr(1),
    base: fr(1.5),
    md: fr(2),
    lg: fr(2.5),
    xl: fr(3),
    "2xl": fr(3.5),
  },
  fontFamily: "Poppins",
};

export default base;
```
