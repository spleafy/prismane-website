- **Table**:
  - Now can change the lines between the columns and rows using the `lines` prop.
  - Now can toggle the table border using the `bordered` prop.
  - Now can make the table appear as 'striped' using the `striped` prop.
  - Now can automatically change the `padding` and `font-size` of the table using the `size` prop, making the table appear smaller or bigger.
- **Tabs**: Now each `Tabs.Tab` can be disabled using the `disabled` prop.
- **Spinner**: Now the color of the spinner can be changed using the `color` prop.

# üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Table**: Fixed a border appearing above the `Table.Head` component.
- **TextField**: Fixed an issue where the `prefix` wasn't shown properly, due to prop inheritance.
