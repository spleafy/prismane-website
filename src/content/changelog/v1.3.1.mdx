# üßæ Release Notes

This new version fixes an important issue in the useFocusTrap hook, which didn't search in-depth for the focusable element when a `data-initialfocus` attribute is used. Thus meaning that if for example a complex input component is used and the `data-initialfocus` attribute is passed to the wrapper, the hook would try to focus the wrapper. Also the issue where the `isOpen` boolean didn't toggle the hook is fixed with this version. This version also fixes a small bug in the `TextField` component, which passed the rest of the props to the label, instead of the wrapper.
